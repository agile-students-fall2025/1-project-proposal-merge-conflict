# SuperMix: A Web-Based Audio Mixer

---

## What and Why?
SuperMix is a web app that users to **upload, edit, enhance, and export audio content**. The system solves the problem of fragmented audio production tools. Currently, creating podcasts or audio projects relies on multiple tools for trimming, noise reduction, normalization, and format conversion. SuperMix centralizes these tasks one platform. 

**Why this is important:** Audio content creation have become central to some college campus culture—clubs, classes, and independent creators. This provides a quick and efficient way to produce high quality audio without spending hours learning complex software, making audio creation accessible to more people.

## For Whom?
The end-users are **college students, campus creators, and individual creators** who are just starting out producing audio content. Some examples include:  
- Student-run podcasts and media clubs  
- Professors or students creating audio lectures or presentations  
- Student musicians or performers creating collaborative tracks  

These are users that have busy schedules. Thus, speeding up the production workflow, all within a single, convenient platform will save time.

## How?
From an end-user perspective, SuperMix will:  
1. **Upload Audio Files** – Users can upload MP3, WAV, or other audio formats.  
2. **Edit and Process Audio** – Users can trim sections, normalize volume, remove silence, and apply simple effects (speed/pitch changes, filters).  
3. **Visual Feedback** – Users see an interactive waveform of their audio to make precise edits.  
4. **Batch Processing** – Multiple audio files can be processed at once, e.g., normalizing all podcast episodes in a series.  
5. **Export** – Users can export in MP3 or WAV format with a single click, ready to publish.  
6. **Optional Enhancements** – Future iterations could include adding intro/outro clips, generating audiograms (waveform videos), or collaborative track mixing.

## Scope
SuperMix is scoped for a team of 4–6 students over one semester. Core features, like uploading, trimming, normalizing, and exporting audio, can be implemented in the first few sprints. Later sprints can extend the platform with batch processing, effect presets, and visualizations, if time allows. The project is challenging but achievable, and results in a polished audio creation tool for students and individual creators.
